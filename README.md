Easy Floor Map Android APP
==========================

A powerful Application to easily map indoor floors with your android smart phone, based on the
WIFI signals surrounding you.

This is an APP I've written in my spare time, I do lot's of WIFI in my profession, writing embedded C,
so this is my first ever android APP. 
The design is horrible, and the code is a real mess I'm not proud of, but the logic behind the scenes is doing a fine work (still needs some tuning).

I would love to share this project for users and for developers that wish to contribute to this technology
and in the future other APP's can rely on this method to do their own stuff. 


So help me do this thing better !

The general idea
==========================
Indoor mapping is a bit of a problem - shopping malls, markets, big buildings, parking garages or any other indoor area that doesn't have GPS reception, but
still want to be "navigable", and basicly more accurate locationing of an individual out in the world.

So the idea is to use the WIFI signals around us, determine their strength (RSSI) which in a way represents the distance from the actual access point (router),
and determine the closest location we are at.

The APP has 2 main modes:
1. Learning mode - mapping a floor using a cell grid to mark a cell grid.
2. Tracking mode - for a previously mapped floor, this mode will let you know where you are!!!
