Learning mode - mapping a floor using a cell grid to mark a cell grid.\r\n2. Tracking mode - for a previously mapped floor, this mode will let you know where you are!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nDownload APK's\r\n--------\r\nAvailable under APK library [the website][2]\r\n\r\n\r\nAndroid APP Sources\r\n-------------------\r\nAvailable under sources library [the website][3]\r\nthis is a very raw and initial sources, my first ever written android APP (I'm a C developer in my profession)\r\nthe design is horrible, but the logic behind the scene is doing a fine work (still needs some tuning)\r\n\r\nContact Me\r\n-----------\r\ngilboash@gmail.com\r\n\r\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/pub/gilboa-shveki/13/641/799\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/gilboash\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n--------\r\n    Under LICENSE.txt\r\n\r\n\r\n [1]: http://easyfloormap.weebly.com/\r\n [2]: https://github.com/gilboash/easyfloormap/tree/easyfloormap_b/APK\r\n [3]: https://github.com/gilboash/easyfloormap/tree/easyfloormap_b/easyfloormap-sources","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
